Step 1: Start with content. As a starting point, we’ll write up raw text content and see what browsers do with it.
Step 2: Give the document structure. You’ll learn about HTML element syntax and the elements that give a document
its structure.
Step 3: Identify text elements. You’ll describe the content using the appropriate text elements and learn about the
proper way to use HTML.
Step 4: Add an image. By adding an image to the page, you’ll learn about attributes and empty elements.
Step 5: Change the page appearance with a style sheet. This exercise gives you a taste of formatting
content with Cascading Style Sheets.
It shows how to open new documents in Notepad and TextEdit. Even if you’ve used these programs before, skim
through for some special settings that will make the exercises go more smoothly.
